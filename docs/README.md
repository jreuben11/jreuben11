       layout: page

       A test github page: https://jreuben11.github.io/jreuben11/
       - deployments: https://github.com/jreuben11/jreuben11/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages

       - looks like I would have to waste time learning Jekyll (Ruby is dead -> not on my critical path.)
